# Dark-Coin-ASA-601894079
Dark Coin is an experimental "grassroots" community project that is working to develop and expand the Algorand ASA defi space. Dark Coin will eventually be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the project is collectively owned / managed by its members based on specific rules enforced by the blockchain.


The Dark Coin team is developing a browser based dapp that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io. Users will be able to use it to send and receive private transactions on the Algorand Network.


Being a DAO, the users of our dapp will also be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projects direction/future. Our governance dApp will allow users to cast votes and submit proposals using NFT voting tokens.
