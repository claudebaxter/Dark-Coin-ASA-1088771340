# Dark-Coin-ASA-601894079
Dark Coin is an experimental "grassroots" community project that is working to develop and expand the Algorand ASA defi space. Dark Coin will eventually be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the project is collectively owned / managed by its members based on specific rules enforced by the blockchain.


The Dark Coin team is developing a browser based dapp that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io. Users will be able to use it to swap Algorand & ASAs, create liquidity pools, and allow users to stake their Dark Coin for rewards.


Being "community driven," the users of our dapp will also be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projects direction/future. Our governance will allow users to stake Dark Coin, cast votes, propose changes, and earn rewards for participation.
