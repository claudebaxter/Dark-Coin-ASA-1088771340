# Dark-Coin-ASA-601894079
Dark Coin is an experimental community project that is working to develop and expand on the Algorand ASA defi space. 
Being "community driven," the users of our coin will be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projects direction/future.  
The Dark Coin team is developing a dapp that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io, in which users can swap Algorand and ASAs on the Algorand network. 
Our dapp also allows users to create liquidity pool pairs, and add liquidity to existing pool pairs using smart contracts. 
Our dapp will also allow users to stake their Dark Coin for rewards.
Our dapp will also include a governance protocol that allows on users to vote on changes to the project on the Algorand blockchain, and earn rewards for doing so.
