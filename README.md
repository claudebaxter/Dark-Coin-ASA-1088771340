# Dark-Coin-ASA-601894079
Dark Coin is an experimental "grassroots" community project that is working to develop and expand the Algorand ASA defi space. Dark Coin will eventually be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the project is collectively owned / managed by its members based on specific rules enforced by the blockchain.


The Dark Coin team is developing a browser based dapp that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io, in which users can execute various smart contracts and transactions on Algorand directly from this platform.


Being "community driven," the users of our dapp will be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projects direction/future. Governance will allow users to stake Dark Coin, cast votes, propose changes, and earn rewards for participation.


Our dapp also allows users to create liquidity pool pairs, and add liquidity to existing pool pairs using smart contracts. 


Our dapp will also allow users to stake their Dark Coin for rewards.
