# Introduction

Dark Coin is an experimental grassroots community project focused on expanding the Algorand DeFi ecosystem. Managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Dark Coin's users collectively own and manage the project based on blockchain-enforced rules and smart contracts. The primary objective of the Dark Coin DAO is to develop privacy solutions for the Algorand Network.

# Disclaimer

Investing in Dark Coin or any cryptocurrency involves risks. The project's creators and developers do not guarantee profits or specific price outcomes for the Dark Coin token. It's essential to conduct thorough research and consider seeking guidance from a financial advisor before investing. Never invest funds you cannot afford to lose.

# Dark Coin tokenomics

The Dark Coin V2 token was minted on April 20th, 2023, with a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens, up to 6 decimals. The asset number is 1088771340. The Dark Coin DAO approved a reimbursement action plan for users affected by the MyAlgo hack, utilizing V2 Dark Coin for reimbursement after the V2 liquidity pool was established. The Dark Coin V1 token was minted on the Algorand blockchain Saturday, February 12, 2022, with a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens.

With the original minting, 400,000,000 Dark Coin were transferred from the creator wallet to create the V1 liquidity pool on Tinyman so that users can exchange the asset, and can contribute additional liquidity to the pool to support the project. 

The remaining 100,000,000 tokens in the creator / developer wallets are used to disburse the early backer air drop, as well as future air drops & contest rewards the community decides to distribute (e.g., rewards to users for our logo contest). This will also be used to partner with other developers to help fund the development costs.

Profits earned from project NFT Sales will be split evenly between providing liquidity and the Marketing & Development wallet.
