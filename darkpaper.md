Project Description:

Dark Coin is an experimental "grassroots" community project that is working to develop and expand the Algorand ASA defi space. 
Dark Coin will eventually be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the project is collectively 
owned / managed by its members based on specific rules enforced by the blockchain.

The Dark Coin team is developing a browser based dapp that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io, in which 
users can execute various smart contracts and transactions on Algorand directly from this platform.

Being "community driven," the users of our dapp will be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projects 
direction/future. Governance will allow users to stake Dark Coin, cast votes, propose changes, and earn rewards for participation.

Our dapp also allows users to create liquidity pool pairs, and add liquidity to existing pool pairs using smart contracts.

Our dapp will also allow users to stake their Dark Coin for rewards.

Tokenomics:

With a total supply of 500,000,000, the Dark Coin token was minted on Algorand blockchain Saturday, February 12, 2022.

400,000,000 of the total supply was transferred from the creator wallet to the liquidity pool wallet on Tinyman.org so that
users can buy/sell the asset, and can contribute additional liquidity to the pool to support the project. User provided liquidity
does not need to be locked, so users are able to withdraw / deposit liquidity from the pool as desired.

Users who locked in 5,000,000 Dark Coin by February 19, 2021 are provided with an initial early backer air drop of 1,000,000 Dark Coin.

The remaining 100,000,000 tokens in the creator / developer wallets are used to disburse the early backer air drop, as well as future
air drops the community decides to distribute (e.g., rewards to users for our logo contest)

Creater and Developer Wallet 2 will not sell or transfer any of the initial 100,000,000 Dark Coin without approval from the community,
as these funds are to be used to provide additional liquidity and fund / promote the project as it expands. Though these wallets will 
"buy back" Dark Coin using personal funds, in which the tokens that were "bought back" can be used at the discretion of the owner.
