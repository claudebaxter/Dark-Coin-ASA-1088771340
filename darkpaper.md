Project Description:

Dark Coin is an experimental "grassroots" community project that is working to develop and expand the Algorand ASA defi space. Dark Coin will eventually be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the project is collectively owned / managed by its users based on specific rules enforced by the blockchain and smart contracts.

The Dark Coin team is developing a browser based dapp that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io. Users will be able to swap Algorand & ASAs, create liquidity pools, and stake their Dark Coin for rewards.

Being "community driven," the users of our dapp will also be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projects direction/future. Our governance will allow users to stake Dark Coin, cast votes, propose changes, and earn rewards for participation.

Tokenomics:

With a total supply of 500,000,000, Dark Coin was minted on Algorand blockchain Saturday, February 12, 2022.

400,000,000 of the total supply was transferred from the creator wallet to the liquidity pool wallet on Tinyman.org so that
users can buy/sell the asset, and can contribute additional liquidity to the pool to support the project.

Users who locked in 5,000,000 Dark Coin by February 19, 2021 are provided with an initial early backer air drop of 1,000,000 Dark Coin.

The remaining 100,000,000 tokens in the creator / developer wallets are used to disburse the early backer air drop, as well as future
air drops the community decides to distribute (e.g., rewards to users for our logo contest)

Creater and Developer Wallet 2 will not sell or transfer any of the initial 100,000,000 Dark Coin without disclosing details to the community
for approval, as these funds are to be used to provide additional liquidity and fund / promote the project as it expands. 

The creator/dev wallets will "buy back" Dark Coin using personal funds, in which the tokens that were "bought back" can be used at the discretion of the owner.
