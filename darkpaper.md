# Introduction

Dark Coin is an experimental grassroots community project to develop and expand the Algorand DEFI ecosystem. Dark Coin is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), meaning that the project is collectively owned / managed by its users based on specific rules enforced by the blockchain and smart contracts.


# Disclaimer

There is no guarantee or promise made from the creator / developers that this project will make investors money. There is no guarantee or promise regarding the direction of the price action of the Dark Coin token.

Investing is always a risk. Anyone considering investing in this project, or crypto in general, should conduct thorough research and consider seeking guidance from a financial advisor. Never invest money that you cannot afford to lose.


# Dark Coin product description and proposed use cases

The Dark Coin team is developing a browser based DAPP that will be accessed via our website, https://dark-coin.io. Our users will be able to send and receive private transactions on the Algorand network.

Being community driven, the users of our DAPP will also be able to use a governance protocol to make decisions on the projectâ€™s direction/future. Our governance will allow users to stake Dark Coin, cast votes, propose changes, and earn additional rewards for participation in governance.

# Dark Coin tokenomics

With a total supply of 500,000,000 tokens, Dark Coin was minted on the Algorand blockchain Saturday, February 12, 2022.

400,000,000 Dark Coin (80% of the total supply) was transferred from the creator wallet to create the liquidity pool on Tinyman.org so that users can buy/sell the asset, and can contribute additional liquidity to the pool to support the project. The LP tokens received for this have been locked through May 31, 2022, on Tinylock. Because we intend to keep this liquidity locked permanently, a vote will be held before the end of May 2022 for the community to decide if we should continue to stay locked with Tinylock, or use another service, and for how long. This is simply to ensure that we are locking the liquidity in a way that is secure and responsible, to avoid theft.

Users who locked in 5,000,000 Dark Coin by February 19, 2022 are provided with an initial early backer reward of 1,000,000 Dark Coin. The early backer program has concluded, and we are keeping this information in the darkpaper for transparency.

The remaining 100,000,000 tokens in the creator / developer wallets are used to disburse the early backer air drop, as well as future air drops & contest rewards the community decides to distribute (e.g., rewards to users for our logo contest). This will also be used to partner with other developers to help fund the development costs.

Both the Creator and Developer Wallet 2 will not sell or transfer any of the initial 100,000,000 Dark Coin without disclosing details to the community for approval, as these funds are to be used to provide additional liquidity, as well as fund and promote the project as it expands.

Currently I am solely responsible for the creation and development of the Dark Coin project. I am seeking to expand our team to partner with new developers to take this project to the next level. It will be up to these individuals if they would prefer to make their identities public or not. I made my identity public because I am accountable for the actions and decisions of our team, and take full responsibility to ensure the production of our services are secure, and to ensure that the liquidity remains locked in a safe way.

There are four other members of our team, at this time we have chosen for them to remain anonymous. Two members of our team help with monitoring our social media channels and making me aware of any questions or comments I overlook. The third member helps us with graphic design and editing, and the fourth member, who we would not be here without, is our web developer / IT support technician. I see no need for these individuals identities to be made public, because they are simply helping me accomplish necessary tasks, but in the end, I am solely responsible for all of the decisions and actions of our team.


# Dark Coin roadmap

Please be aware that dates listed may change based on unfolding circumstances. The dates listed below are simply goals we are setting to hold ourselves accountable in terms of creating a sense of urgency to accomplish these tasks.

Our main goal is to have a functioning closed beta produced within the next six months, by September 30, 2022. I am setting a wide margin as this will require partnering with other developers to achieve this. 

This makes partnering with a developer one of the most critical and urgent tasks we must complete. I am focusing the majority of my efforts to achieve this, idealy I want to have formed this partnership by April 30, 2022, so that we can begin serious work toward the development of the closed beta.

As our project grows, we will need to increase our moderation and marketing efforts. This will require bringing in members of the community as moderators on platforms such as Reddit, Discord, Twitter, and Facebook. Ideally we want the community to help select these individuals in the form of a vote. These individuals will help with the moderation of channels and assisting with communications. Ideally, we would like to accomplish this by May 31, 2022. 

We need to get Dark Coin and our icon listed across all major channels. This will be an ongoing effort as there are always new channels to apply for listings. For now, we are working to be listed on CoinMarketCap, Coingecko, Tinychart, and Algo Directory. Our teams goal is to be listed on all of these channels by May 31, 2022.

We need to achieve verification the Algorand Foundation and AlgoExplorer. For AlgoExplorer, it looks like we will not be able to receive verification until we have a functioning open beta of our DAPP. We are still learning the requirements for verification with the Algorand Foundation. For now, the deadline to accomplish this will be set for December 2022. This date may change as more information becomes available to our team.

We are also in the process of applying for a grant from the Algorand Foundation. We are unsure what to expect in terms of requirements so will have to wait until we receive a response on Algorand regarding our application. Once we get an answer we will update the community and this document accordingly.
