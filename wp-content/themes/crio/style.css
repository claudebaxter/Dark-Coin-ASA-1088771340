Description: Crio is a WordPress SuperTheme that allows front-end designers, developers and other web professionals to create without bounds or restrictions.  Crio’s advanced customization options are completely integrated with the WordPress Customizer API, providing you with a powerful, but familiar interface to customize your website. Our integration gives you granular control over many elements straight from the Customizer, and even device previews so you can see how your site looks on different devices. Crio’s unique color palette system keeps colors consistent across your site. Drag and drop colors in your palette to increase or decrease the usage of that color throughout your website. Use the advanced controls to create a custom Header, Footer, or Blog Page layout. Be Bold and stand above the rest with Crio by BoldGrid!
